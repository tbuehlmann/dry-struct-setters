# Dry::Struct::Setters

[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/dry-struct-setters.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/rb/dry-struct-setters) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tbuehlmann/dry-struct-setters.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tbuehlmann/dry-struct-setters)

Dry::Struct::Setters is an extension to the [Dry::Struct](https://github.com/dry-rb/dry-struct) library. Subclasses of Dry::Struct only define getter methods for its attributes by design (or preference). This library extends subclasses so they also provide setter methods.

## Usage

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'dry-struct-setters'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install dry-struct-setters


## Development
